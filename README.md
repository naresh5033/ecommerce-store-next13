# Dependencies (Admin)

- shadcn/ui we will set up this project using the shadcn/ui .. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs.
- the shadcn uses the radix ui for its components as the underlying ui, so when we install shadcn it will install the radix ui as well, and when we use/ import the comp in our project we wana make sure that we use the shadcn comps, since they both has the same name.
- for ex if we wana add a button ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add button``` this will create a button component in the comp dir/ui/button.ts
- we can add the user button or any comp, all modular
- for the dialog ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog```
- for the combo box we can directly install, and its a combination of popover and command ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add popover``` and ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add command``` and this combo box we can use it for our store switcher
- ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add form``` - forms(uses react hook form and zod), lly add the input (for our form)
- ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add separator``` - the separator line <hr>

- for the data table(the recommended way is to creat a cust one) ```npx shadcn-ui@latest add table dropdown-menu``` and ```npm i @tanstack/react-table``` 
- if we look into the doc it says 3 steps to follow 1. column definition 2. <DataTable> component, 
- then add  the pagination to the table Update Table. ve to add getPaginationRowModel, then add the pagination control, and other funcionalities such as filtering, sorting
- ```npx create-next-app@latest ecommerce-admin --typescript --tailwind --eslint```
- ```npx shadcn-ui@latest init```
    - while creating use the app-router (instead of pages the old way of creating the   api) which heavily rely on the server comp
    - and with this we can make the route grouping as well ex app/(root)/
    - and each group can ve its own layout 
- clerk for the authentication ```npm install @clerk/nextjs``` - it provides the clerk provider (in both app-router and the page router) which we can wrap our app.
  - and then ve to create a middleware(as per doc)
  - and app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx --> is the routing convention in order for the clerk to provide the authentication. 
  - and lly for the sign-in app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
- zustand - for the state management. ```npm i zustand```
- Prisma (orm) ```npm i -D prisma``` and add add the client ```npm i @prisma/client``` then ```npx  prisma init``` will creates a prisma.shema file, and to add/ gen store  ```npx prisma generate``` and it will also gen/ add store to our node module, ```npx prisma db push``` to push the schema to database.
- ```npm prisma migrate reset``` to reset the database
- for the database we can use the planetscale (mysql) provider
- axios ```npm i axios``` for fetching data
- react-toast ```npm i react-hot-toast``` for the notification, make it as a provider and add it the layout
- icons from the lucid-react ```npm i lucide-react```

- dark theme ```npm i next-themes```, refer the code in shadcn and wrap our root layout with this theme provider and we can also grab the toggle(can use it in the nav bar) code for our theme from the shadcn
